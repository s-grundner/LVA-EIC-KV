%% The above lines help editors like TeXstudio to automatically choose the right tools
%% to compile your LaTeX source file. If your tool does not support these magic comments,
%% you will need to make appropriate manual choices.
%% 
%% You can safely use "pdflatex" instead of "xelatex" if you prefer the pdfLaTeX toolchain.
%% However, pdfLaTeX will not be able to deliver the professional font experience that you
%% will get with XeLaTeX. You can also safely use "lualatex" instead of "xelatex" while
%% preserving the professional font experience if you prefer the LuaLaTeX toolchain.
%% 
%% _Important_: These magic comments should be on the first lines of your source file.

%% This is an example file for using the JKU LaTeX technical report template
%% for your technical report.
%% 
%% Template created by Michael Roland (2021)
%% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% 
%% Document class: This is a koma-script article.
%% 
\documentclass[a4paper,oneside,11pt,english]{scrartcl}
%% 
%% The comma-separated list in square brackets are class options.
%% Useful options that you might want to use:
%% 
%% Paper size:
%%  * a4paper ... A4 paper size
%% 
%% Optimize for single-sided or double-sided printing:
%%  * oneside ... single-sided
%%  * twoside ... double-sided
%% 
%% Base font size:
%%  * 10pt ... 10-pt font is used for normal text
%%  * 11pt ... 11-pt font is used for normal text
%% 
%% Define document languages (the last specified language becomes the document default
%% language):
%%  * ngerman ... German
%%  * english ... English
%%  * ...
%% 
%% Alternate document classes: The JKU report template supports the koma-script classes
%% `scrartcl', `scrreprt' and `scrbook'. The article class `scrartcl' is well-suited
%% for a typical technical report. However, `scrbook' or `scrreprt' may be better
%% suited for longer reports since they permit structuring your work in chapters.
%%  
%% _Important_: The document class should be the first line of LaTeX code in your main
%% source file. Do not place anything but comments / magic comments above that line (unless
%% you really know what you are doing).

%% The comma-separated list in square brackets are theme options. Useful options that you
%% might want to use:
%% 
%% Document type:
%%  * phdthesis     ... PhD thesis.
%%  * mathesis      ... Master's thesis.
%%  * diplomathesis ... Diploma thesis.
%%  * bathesis      ... Bachelor's thesis.
%%  * seminarreport ... Seminar report.
%%  * techreport    ... Technical report.
%% 
%% Color scheme selection options:
%%  * JKU  ... Use JKU (gray) color scheme (this is the default if no scheme is selected).
%%  * BUS  ... Use Business School color scheme.
%%  * LIT  ... Use Linz Institute of Technology color scheme.
%%  * MED  ... Use MED faculty color scheme.
%%  * RE   ... Use RE faculty color scheme.
%%  * SOE  ... Use School of Education color scheme.
%%  * SOWI ... Use SOWI faculty color scheme.
%%  * TNF  ... Use TNF faculty color scheme.
%% 
%% Space-efficient monospace font options (requires XeTeX/LuaTeX):
%%  * compactmono   ... Use condensed fixed-width font everywhere.
%%  * nocompactverb ... Do not use condensed fixed-width font for verbatim and listings.
%% 
%% Style-breaking options:
%%  * noimprint      ... Do not insert imprint on title pages.
%%  * nojkulogo      ... Do not insert JKU & K logos on title pages.
%%  * capstitle      ... Set document title in capital letters.
%%  * nofancyfonts   ... Do not use custom TTF fonts with XeTeX/LuaTeX / supress pdfLaTeX warning.
%%  * equalmargins   ... Decrease the outer page margin to have both page margins of equal size
%%                       (the additional outer margin is intentional and to be used for
%%                       anotations; equalmargins also causes the text width to be
%%                       significantly larger than optimal for reading).
%% 
%% Experimental options:
%%  * mathastext ... Use standard document fonts (enhanced with symbols from Fira Math font
%%                   when using XeTeX/LuaTeX) in math mode.
%% 
%% Advanced options:
%%  * noautopdfinfo     ... Do not automatically try to add pdfinfo with hyperref from document
%%                          metadata fields.
%%  * logopath={<path>} ... Set the path where the theme can find its own logo resources. This
%%                          should typically be a relative path and the default is `./logos'.
%%  * fontpath={<path>} ... Set the path where the theme can find its own font resources. This
%%                          should typically be a relative path and the default is `./fonts'.
%% 
%% Hint: Boolean options can be used in the forms `option' or `option=true' the enable the
%% option and `nooption' or `option=false' to disable the option.

Synthesizer Oscillator stack routing:

Oscillators store the MIDI note number (0-127) in a register.

Incoming Note ON:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Find first free oscillator (enabled = 0 -> unlocked)
    \item and write note number to register
    \item set enabled = 1 (locked).
\end{itemize}

Incoming Note OFF:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Find matching note number in all oscillators
    \item set enabled = 0 (unlocked)
    \item Disable flag: midi\_note == stored\_note AND note\_off
\end{itemize}
